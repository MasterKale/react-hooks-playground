# React Hooks Playground

## Requirements
- Node v10.15.2
- Yarn

## Development

To install dependencies:

```sh
$> yarn install
```

To start the dev server:

```sh
$> yarn start
```

## Notes

- The **hooks-vs-hocs** folder contains functionally-equivalent code. One set is written using "traditional" Class Components and HOCs. The other is written using Function Components and Hooks.
- The **budget-tracker** folder contains Hooks-heavy code as it might appear when developing an actual product using the latest React.
